# Unity assignment week 3: game of war between airships and spaceships. 
This game is an airship that fights enemy spaceships. The player starts with 3 lives. Every time a spaceship hits an airship, the player loses a life. When he reaches 0 lives and is disqualified, he will reach Game-Over. Throughout the game, small hearts will appear on the screen, each heart collected will add life to the player. The airship destroys spaceships by shooting. Each hit on the spaceship adds a point to the player. When the player has 10 points, X2 will appear on the screen for 7 seconds, allowing the player to double their score. In each stage, the player can use a power-up once for 7 seconds, during which they can shoot in 3 directions at the same time. To pass a stage, they must go in the direction of the arrow.
* The player moves using the arrow keys on the keyboard and shoots using the spacebar on the keyboard.

* I chose to perform additions 3 and 4 of the assignment which are- 
- Changing the boundaries of the game- The game is circular on the horizontal axis. And a closed world on the vertical axis. (When the player moves right until the float is finally on the left side of the screen)
- The player's spaceship is not immediately destroyed when it collides with an enemy, but at the beginning of the game it has 3 "health points", each hit on an enemy reduces it by one point, and only when it reaches zero is it destroyed. Occasionally, "health points" appear on the screen that the player can collect and add to himself.
* In addition, I added two independent new features:
- In each level, the player can upgrade their shooting ability once for 7 seconds. The upgraded shooting fires bullets in three directions at once, allowing the player to triple their firepower. 
- Once per game, when the player reaches 10 points, an icon appears on the screen for 7 seconds. Activating it allows the player to double their score
