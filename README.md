# Unity assignment week 3: game of war between airships and spaceships. 
This game is an airship that fights enemy spaceships. The player starts with 3 lives. Every time a spaceship hits an airship, the player loses a life. When he reaches 0 lives and is disqualified, he will reach Game-Over. Throughout the game, small hearts will appear on the screen, each heart collected will add life to the player. The airship destroys spaceships by shooting. Each hit on the spaceship adds a point to the player. When the player has 10 points, X2 will appear on the screen for 7 seconds, allowing the player to double their score. In each stage, the player can use a power-up once for 7 seconds, during which they can shoot in 3 directions at the same time. To pass a stage, they must go in the direction of the arrow.
* The player moves using the arrow keys on the keyboard and shoots using the spacebar on the keyboard.
